# RandomArt
This package allows you to create random art, using the make_art function.

# Make_art() usage
The make_art() function generates random pieces of art. 
It allows you to run it with an argument that sets the seed.
So make_art(45) runs the function with set.seed(45).
This allows you to recreate the same artwork multiple times.
You can also run it without any argument, 
this default argument allows you to create a random, unique piece of art each time you run the function.
